# 42-basecamp

### _Exercises done in basecamp at school 42 - São Paulo unit. (July/ 2021)._

Participant in the Basecamp of the technology school - 42 São Paulo.
This basecamp is the last step in the selection process to become the 42 São Paulo student. We studied and learned some features of the C language, shell, git and github.

### _C00:_

- [`ft_putchar`](c/c00/ex00/ft_putchar.c) - write a character that displays the character passed as a parameter.
- [`ft_print_alphabet`](c/c00/ex01/ft_print_alphabet.c) - displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by ascending order, starting from the letter ’a’.
- [`ft_print_reverse_alphabet`](c/c00/ex02/ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c) - displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by descending order, starting from the letter ’z’.
- [`ft_print_numbers`](c/c00/ex03/ft_print_numbers.c) - displays all digits, on a single line, by ascending order.
- [`ft_is_negative`](c/c00/ex04/ft_is_negative.c) - displays ’N’ or ’P’ depending on the integer’s sign entered
as a parameter. If n is negative, display ’N’. If n is positive or null, display ’P’.
- [`ft_print_comb`](c/c00/ex05/ft_print_comb.c) - displays all different combinations of three different digits in ascending order, listed by ascending order:
`012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, ..., 789$`
- [`ft_print_comb2`](c/c00/ex06/ft_print_comb2.c) - displays all different combination of two digits between 00 and 99, listed by ascending order:
`00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05, ..., 00 99, 01 02, ..., 97 99, 98 99$`

### _C01:_

- [`ft_ft`](c/c01/ex00/ft_ft.c) - takes a pointer to int as a parameter, and sets the value "42" to that int.
- [`ft_ultimate_ft`](c/c01/ex01/ft_ultimate_ft.c) - takes a pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to int as a parameter and sets the value "42" to that int.
- [`ft_swap`](c/c01/ex02/ft_swap.c) - swaps the value of two integers whose addresses are entered as parameters.
- [`ft_div_mod`](c/c01/ex03/ft_div_mod.c) - divides parameters a by b and stores the result in the int pointed by div.
- [`ft_ultimate_div_mod`](c/c01/ex04/ft_ultimate_div_mod.c) - divides parameters a by b. The result of this division is stored in the int pointed by a.
- [`ft_putstr`](c/c01/ex05/ft_putstr.c) - displays a string of characters on the standard output.
- [`ft_strlen`](c/c01/ex06/strlen.c) - counts and returns the number of characters in a string.
